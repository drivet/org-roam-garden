[[id:701D2448-34FA-44F6-9701-4F0CF3369397][Christianity and the Bible]]

The Bible says a lot of things, and Christians don't follow much of it (if
they did, they'd go to jail).  A lot of Christianity is base on cherry
picking bits from the Bible.

How people cherry pick depends on pre-exiting beliefs. The hate comes
_first_, the biblical justification comes second.
