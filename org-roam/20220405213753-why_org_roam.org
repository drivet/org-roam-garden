#+title: Why org-roam?

Why org-roam and not something like Roam Research?

 * You can leverage the power of [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] and [[id:FA31BDBE-5F87-4DEE-ABE2-D8AFD52F7D03][Org Mode]] but maybe more
   importantly
 * You can store all your notes in [[id:a2e09732-e1f9-4e01-a5fa-74092ae75cd5][plain text]] which means there's a better
   chance they will last longer

This is especially important for something like a Zettelkasten, which is
supposed to be a life long companion, with your notes lasting years, maybe
even decades.  Do we think Roam Research will be around 30 years from now?
Emacs and plain text will be.
