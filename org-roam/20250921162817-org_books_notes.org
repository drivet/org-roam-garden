This is an [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] package for managing reading lists in [[id:FA31BDBE-5F87-4DEE-ABE2-D8AFD52F7D03][Org Mode]].

Doesn't work very well:

 * Claims to support Amazon, Goodreads and [[id:fc68e2a2-2b53-43ea-865a-4eb8d7877eb3][Open Library]] URLs, but Goodreads
   doesn't work and Open Library only works when you use the Legacy Books
   API JSON URL.

 * Inserts the URL provided as a properties field which doesn't look nice
   when exported.

 * Doesn't insert the cover anywhere.

 * You can insert books via ISBN, but this is implemnted in terms of Open
   Library, with the aforementioned problems.
