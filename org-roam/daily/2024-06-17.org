Part of [[id:0AC9298C-1F59-4518-8E3B-00EE144A3AF4][daily notes]]

 * I wonder if I'm geeky enough.  Or maybe if I'm too passive.
 * Do I want to matter?  Or am I just afraid of trying to matter, for fear
   of failure?
 * People have commented at Unity that I lack confidence, which is true
   enough.
