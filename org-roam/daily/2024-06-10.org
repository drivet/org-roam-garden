 * I need to have projects, which is why trouble myself with weird emacs and
   text based blogging and note taking systems.  It's not always that the
   result is *better*, I just enjoy the process of building it.  Of course
   the, you do often end up with a system that you have full control over,
   so that's good.
 * To be it another way, I enjoy building more than using.
