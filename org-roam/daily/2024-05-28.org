 * There's always a little rush when I make a trade on TD or Wealthsimple.
   It's gambling rush I suppose.  Need to avoid getting addicted.
   
 * Vanguard makes it easy to hold global bond ETFs because...they use
   currency hedging?  From what I can tell this is a relatively new thing,
   and historically people have just bought home base bond funds.
