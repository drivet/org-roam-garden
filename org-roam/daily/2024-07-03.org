Some quotes I found in Instagram today:

 * People only saw the decisions I made, not the choices I had
 * Kindness without honesty is manipulation and honesty without kindness is
   brutality
 * Do you actually want, or do you want other people to see you have it?
 * Whatever you are not changing, you are choosing.
 * You can be the sweetest peach on the tree but some people just don't like
   peaches.
 * If you wouldn't ask for their opinion, don't accept their criticism.
 * Procrastination is the arrogant assumption that God owes you another
   chance to do tomorrow what He have you the chance to do today.
 * Peace is letting people be wrong about you
 * It's never too late to be what you might have been.
