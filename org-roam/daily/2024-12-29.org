 * Reading [[id:2c7c0b6d-cfdc-4a22-be7b-f8026ccc84a5][Atomic Habits]] and the yo-yo effect, wherein you complete a goal
   and then stagnate really resonated with me.
 * "You do not rise to the level of your goals.  You fall to the level of
   your training,"
 * I think Lisp is associated with AI because of it blurs the lines between
   data and code.  It's the idea that a Lisp program isn't set in stone but
   is in theory a self-modifying entity, changing itself as it runs.  To be
   fair, I've never actually seen a Lisp like this.
