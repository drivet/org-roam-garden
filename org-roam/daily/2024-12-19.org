 * Comparing Trump and Harris on policy is a bit rich when one of them won't
   respect the results of an election.
 * The distrust I feel for Harris is like for a politician.  The distrust I
   feel for Trump is like for a mobster
 * I always thought that being a billionaire came with privilege, but that
   it surfaced as the ability to cover your tracks better.  With Trump it
   seems you just have to make people not care.
 * Trump showed how much of our justice system is based on the good will of
   good actors.
