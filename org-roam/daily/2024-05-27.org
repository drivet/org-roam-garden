 * Warren Buffet is not a billionaire because he's frugal.  He's a
   billionaire because he's good at investing.  I think sometimes the two
   mindsets become conflated.

 * I guess you can recreate a simple recipe book with org-roam, but why?
   It's power is in the connections, so maybe do something personal, like
   how the recipe connects back to a memory, or a recipe template, or a
   cooking technique you learned.
