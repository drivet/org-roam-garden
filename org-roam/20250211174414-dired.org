An [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] mode for manipulating directories and files.

C-x d to start it, will show a listing of the directory
contents. ~dired-listing-switches~ to configure the initial listing.

** Visiting/Viewing Files

 * RET to go and visit the file
 * v to view the file (can press q to quit the buffer, a bit like a stack)
 * C-o to open file in another buffer but don't focus it.

** Marking

Basic mark is m, and u to unmark, with a U to unmark everything like a
reset.

You can mark a subset of files like:

 * ~* .~ means to mark by extension
 * ~* /~ to mark directories
 * ~* *~ to mark executables

You use t to invert the marks, so I guess you could use it to select all
non-directories by doing a ~* / t~
