gnus-directory

Most Gnus storage file and directory variables will be initialized from this
variable, which defaults to the SAVEDIR environment variable, or `~/News/'
if that variable isn't set. Note that Gnus is mostly loaded when the
`~/.gnus.el' file is read. This means that other directory variables that
are initialized from this variable won't be set properly if you set this
variable in ~/.gnus.el'. Set this variable in .emacs' instead.

message-directory

 - defaults to ~/Mail

message-auto-save-directory

 - defaults to ~/Mail/drafts/
