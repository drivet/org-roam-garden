#+title: Org Mode Images

[[id:FA31BDBE-5F87-4DEE-ABE2-D8AFD52F7D03][Org Mode]]

Org mode handles local images and not remote images out of the box, but if
you set up [[https://github.com/gaoDean/org-remoteimg][org-remoteimg]] then org mode can handle remote images as well.

If you so use org-remoteimg, set this:

~(setq org-display-remote-inline-images 'cache)~

(TODO: figure out where it keeps the cache)

Some docs:

https://orgmode.org/manual/Images.html

One major function I can find is ~org-toggle-inline-images~ (C-c C-x C-v).
With org-remoteimg this works with remote images as well.

Relevant variable: ~org-image-actual-width~.  Set this to nil and you can do
something like this in your org doc:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px

or 

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 300px

And the image will be set to that width.  But the latter will have no effect
when exporting to HTML so maybe best to use the first one.
