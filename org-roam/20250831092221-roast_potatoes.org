Easy and tasty.  Other recipes will boil them first but I find that too much
work.

Yield: 6 servings

** Ingredients

 * 2 pounds potatoes (russet works well) about 3 large ones
 * 2 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1 teaspoon rosemary
 * 1 teaspoon thyme
 * 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
 * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
 * salt to taste (1/2 to 1 teaspoon)

** Instructions

Cut potatoes into cubes.  If the potato is large, cut it in half, then cut
each half into 6.  If the potato is medium, cut in half then each half into
4.  If the potato is small, cut into 4.

Put all ingredients into a ziploc bag.  Close the bag, shake it well.
Alternatively, put everything into a big bowl and mix well.

Place the seasoned potatoes on a baking sheet and spread out as much as you
can.  Bake at 450 F for 20-25 minutes.
