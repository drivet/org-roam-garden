#+title: VNC basics

[[id:9b39db1c-a987-4a6f-8d3b-4d0cc2596867][Linux Administration]]

Not much to say here.  I wanted a way to access my desktop at work.  The way
to do this is with x11vnc which will attach a VNC process to an existing X
display.  This page is extremely useful:

http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/

vncserver won't cut it; it can't latch onto an existing X11 session.  You
need x11vnc.  Just run

#+begin_src 
x11vnc -display :0 -rfbauth /path/to/passwordfile
#+end_src

Default /path/to/passwordfile is ~/.vnc/passwd, hence:

#+begin_src 
x11vnc -display :0 -rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd
#+end_src

If you don't have a password file, run x11vnc without one and it will tell
you how to make one.

You need to have vncviewer running at home, and then point it at your remote
machine, at whatever display x11vnc tells you.
