#+title: Microformats turn webpages into REST services

Since a [[id:fc419761-940f-4371-ba30-41ff61220302][microformat]] parser can extract structured data from an arbitrary
HTML page, one can say that microformats turn a website into a RESTful data
service.  In others word, microformats allow webpages to double as RESTful
data resources

This notion used extensively in the [[id:f9b01190-b396-4e6a-a912-83167d33968d][IndieWeb]] to implement a kind of social
network on top of the web itself.
