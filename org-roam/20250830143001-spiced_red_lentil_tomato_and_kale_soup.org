Yield: 4 servings

** Ingredients

 * 1 tablespoon (15 mL) extra-virgin olive oil
 * 2 large garlic cloves, minced
 * 1 sweet onion, diced
 * 3 celery stalks, diced
 * 1 bay leaf
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
 * 2 teaspoons chili powder
 * 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
 * 1/2 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika, to taste
 * 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
 * 1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can diced tomatoes, with juices
 * 5 to 6 cups (1.25 to 1.5L) low-sodium vegetable broth, as needed
 * 1 cup uncooked red lentils, rinsed and drained
 * Fine grain sea salt and pepper, to taste
 * 3 handfuls destemmed and chopped kale leaves or baby spinach

** Instructions

In a large pot, sauté the onion and garlic in the oil for about 4 to 5
minutes over medium heat. Add in the celery and sauté for a few minutes
more.

Stir in the bay leaf and the spices (cumin, chili powder, coriander,
paprika, cayenne).

Stir in the can of tomatoes (including the juice), broth, and lentils. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer, uncovered, for about 20 to 25
minutes, until lentils are tender and fluffy.

Stir in kale or spinach and cook until just wilted. Serve and enjoy! The
cooled soup can be stored in an air-tight container in the fridge for 3 to 5
days, or you can freeze it in a freezer-safe container (leave 1-inch at the
top for expansion) for 1 to 2 months.
