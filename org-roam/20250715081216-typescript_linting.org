#+title: Typescript Linting

It can be a bit daunting to set up linting and formatting for [[id:f9046198-ca6b-4891-9744-ecd9bb6d2bb1][Typescript]].
I'll trying a summarize the state of things here - by which I mean,
summarize what we use at Unity, which seems to do the trick.

First, make a distinction between linters and formatters.

 * Linters flag possible bugs and bad practices
 * Formatters fix your code to conform to style guides.

First, use [[https://eslint.org/][eslint]] for linting.  This is a [[id:de508103-e007-4aa0-8bfc-a290428f543f][Javascript]] linter that has been
updated to support Typescript.

Next, use [[https://prettier.io/][prettier]] for formatting.  It's opinionated and generally good.

Note that eslint can also do formatting There is therefore some overlap
between these tools, so you have to set them up in such a way that they
don't conflict.
