Yield: 1 quart (12 servings)

** Ingredients

 * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
 * 8 tablespoons (4 oz) unsalted butter, divided
 * 1 cup chopped onion (1 onion)
 * 1 1/3 cups chopped celery (about two ribs)
 * 1 1/3 cups chopped carrot (about 2 carrots)
 * 1 1/2 pound ground chuck
 * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
 * 2 cups whole milk
 * 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, or a pinch ground nutmeg
 * 2 cups dry white wine
 * 3 cups canned imported Italian San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand, with their juice
  
** Instructions

In a heavy 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat, warm the oil and 6
tablespoons butter until the butter melts and stops foaming. Toss in the
onion and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is softened and
translucent, about 5 minutes.

Toss in the celery and carrot and cook, stirring to coat them with the oil
and butter, for 2 minutes.

Add the chuck and pork, a very healthy pinch of salt, and a goodly amount of
pepper. Crumble the meat with a wooden spoon and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the meats have just lost their raw-red color.

Reduce the heat to low. Pour in the milk and simmer gently, stirring
frequently, until the liquid has completely evaporated, about 1 hour.

Stir in the nutmeg. Pour in the wine and gently simmer, stirring frequently,
until it's evaporated, about 1 1/4 hours more.  Add the tomato purée or
crushed tomatoes and stir well. When the tomato puree begins to bubble, turn
down the heat so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers with just an
intermittent bubble breaking the surface.

Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more, stirring from time to time. While the
sauce is burbling away, there's a chance that it'll start drying out. To
keep the sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pot and scorching, add 1/2
cup water if necessary, just know that it's crucial that by the time the
sauce has finished simmering, the water should be completely evaporated, and
the fat should separate from the sauce.

Taste a spoonful—or two—of sauce and season with salt and pepper to
taste. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the hot pasta and toss with
the sauce. Serve with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano on the side.
