#+title: Exposure Triangle

[[id:9f1a8982-7a7e-4918-a48d-278907e7f217][Photography]]

Exposure is the amount of light that hits your sensor.

Lots of good articles.  Here's one:
https://photographylife.com/what-is-exposure

The exposure triangle are 3 settings that all interact to give you a
"properly exposed" photo:

 * Shutter speed
 * Aperture
 * ISO sensitivity

According to this article:

https://visualwilderness.com/fieldwork/reason-change-iso-in-photography

You should just keep you ISO setting at the lowest and vary the other two
settings.  The article says that you should only change your ISO when you're
targeting a particular shutter speed.  Higher ISO sensitivity tends to
increase noise.

Remember that exposure is about how much light reaches your film.
Technically, ISO sensitivity isn't really about that.  So really we have
shutter speed and aperture.

** Shutter Speed

Exposure is about how much light reaches your film.  Technically, ISO
sensitivity isn't really about that.  So really we have shutter speed and
aperture.

Shutter Speed is measured in time.  It's the amount of time the camera
spends taking the photo.  More time means more light coming in.  Too long
and the photo is over exposed.  Too short and it's under-exposed.

Shutter speed is also about *motion*.  Small exposure means you have a
better chance of capturing a fast moving object.  In particular, zooming in
magnifies speed, and you'll want a smaller shutter speed for a fast moving
object.

From the above article, quick and dirty guideline:

#+begin_quote
Want a quick-and-dirty guideline? Use 1/500 second or faster for sports and
wildlife action. Use 1/100 second or faster for telephoto portrait
images. Use 1/50 second or faster for wider-angle portrait or travel photos
where your subject isnâ€™t moving too much. If your subject is completely
still, and you have a tripod, use any shutter speed you want.

** Aperture

This is the size of the hole that lets the light in.  It's measured as a
fraction, f/N.  So f/2 is a bigger aperture than f/16, i.e. it lets more
light in.

Aperture controls exposure and depth of field.  Exposure is the amount of
light you let in.  Field of depth controls how much of your image appears
sharp.

Small apertures (f/11, f/16) give you a large field of depth, which will
make your entire photo, front to back, appear sharp.  Use this for landscape
photos.  Remember that this lets less light in, though (less exposure).
Counteract will longer shutter speed (though you may need a tripod at some
point).

Large apertures (f/1.4 or f/2.8) give you a thin Depth of field and will
give a shallow focus effect, good if you're trying to make "zero in" on one
part of the photo.  Remember that this let's more light in, though (more
exposure).  Counteract with smaller shutter speed.
