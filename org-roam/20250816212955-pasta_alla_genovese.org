Yield: 4-6 servings

** Ingredients

 * 1 1/2 pounds (700 g) boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 4-by-3-inch pieces
 * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
 * 1/4 cup (60 g; 60 ml) lard or extra-virgin olive oil (see note)
 * 3 1/2 ounces (100 g) carrots, peeled and cut into small dice (2 small carrots)
 * 1 celery rib (75 g), trimmed and cut into small dice
 * 3 pounds (1.4 kg) yellow or red onions, thinly sliced, divided
 * 1 tablespoon (15 g) tomato paste
 * 1 cup (240 ml) dry white wine, divided
 * 1 bay leaf
 * 5 ounces (150 g) cherry tomatoes (optional, see note)
 * 1 pound (450 g) short tubular dried pasta such as ziti, paccheri, or rigatoni (see note)
 * 1 loosely packed cup (1/2 ounce; 15 g) fresh parsley leaves and tender stems, finely chopped
 * Finely grated Pecorino Romano

** Instructions

Season beef all over with salt and pepper; set aside and let sit for at
least 45 minutes before cooking.  Salted raw pieces of beef in a baking pan.

Meanwhile, in a large Dutch oven, heat lard or olive oil over medium-high
heat until shimmering. Add carrots and celery, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add roughly
1/3 of the onions (about 1 pound; 450g), season lightly with salt, and
continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are also softened but
not browned, about 5 minutes.

Add tomato paste and 1/4 cup (60ml) wine. Use a wooden spoon to stir and
scrape the bottom and sides of the pot to release any stuck-on bits, then
spread onion mixture into an even layer covering bottom of the pot. Reduce
heat to medium-low and add beef, nestling pieces into onion mixture in a
single layer. Cover beef with remaining onions (about 2 pounds; 900g), add
bay leaf, season lightly with salt, and cover pot with lid.

Cook, uncovering and stirring occasionally to ensure vegetables and beef
aren't sticking to bottom of the pot, until onions are very soft and have
released their moisture, about 1 hour. Adjust heat as needed to maintain a
gentle, steady simmer, and try to keep a layer of onion mixture between beef
and bottom of the pot.

Crack lid slightly so that pot is not completely covered and continue to
cook until beef is tender, offering little resistance when pressed with a
wooden spoon or poked with a paring knife, about 1 hour and 30 minutes
longer. Using tongs, remove beef and bay leaf; set beef aside to cool
slightly and discard bay leaf.

Add remaining 3/4 cup (180ml) wine and cherry tomatoes (if using) to onion
mixture and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Once beef is cool enough
to handle, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces and add back to the pot. Season with
salt to taste and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes begin to burst
and mixture is reduced to a saucy braised rag√π consistency, about 15
minutes. You can coax the beef pieces into breaking down slightly by
prodding them with a wooden spoon, but don't overdo it; the goal is to have
a mixture of distinct pieces of beef and some shredded bits that meld into
the sauce.

Meanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until just shy of al
dente (1 to 2 minutes less than the package directs). Using a spider
skimmer, transfer pasta to the sauce, along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta
cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh
strainer, making sure to reserve at least 1 cup (240ml) pasta cooking water.

Increase heat to high and cook, stirring rapidly, until pasta is al dente
and sauce is thickened and coats noodles, 1 to 2 minutes, adding more pasta
water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed. Remove from heat, add parsley,
and stir rapidly to incorporate. Season with salt to taste. Serve
immediately, passing grated cheese at the table.
