I participate in the IndieWeb, a collection of personal websites meshed
together into something resembling a social network.

** Why?

Interesting question.  A lot of IndieWeb enthusiasts will tell you it's
about keeping control of your own data.  This is true for me to some
extent - I want to keep all my blog entries in a form that will be relevant
in 20 years time and safe on my disk, though maybe that's more about using
[[id:a2e09732-e1f9-4e01-a5fa-74092ae75cd5][plain text]] than about controlling your data.

Photos too; I like keeping those under my control.

For things like notes or likes, it's less important, but still kinda neat.

** How?

Basically [[id:fc419761-940f-4371-ba30-41ff61220302][microformats]].  They are effectively the API of the IndieWeb.
