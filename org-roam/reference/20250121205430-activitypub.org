#+title: ActivityPub

Users are actors and actors have inboxes (messages to read) and outboxes
(messages to send)

#+begin_quote
 * You can POST to someone's inbox to send them a message (server-to-server
   / federation only... this is federation!)
 * You can GET from your inbox to read your latest messages
   (client-to-server; this is like reading your social network stream)
 * You can POST to your outbox to send messages to the world
   (client-to-server)
 * You can GET from someone's outbox to see what messages they've posted (or
   at least the ones you're authorized to see). (client-to-server and/or
   server-to-server)
#+end_quote

Actors post activities to their outbox, or sometimes objects, like a note,
but that just gets wrapped up in a Create, for example.  This is done via
client to server interactions.  A client will POST to the actor's outbox,
discoverable via their profile.

The federation part of Activity happens via server to server interactions.
Activities get posted to actors' inboxes.

#+begin_quote
Delivery is usually triggered by, for example:

 * an Activity being created in an actor's outbox with their Followers Collection as the recipient.
 * an Activity being created in an actor's outbox with directly addressed recipients.
 * an Activity being created in an actors's outbox with user-curated collections as recipients.
 * an Activity being created in an actor's outbox or inbox which references another object.
