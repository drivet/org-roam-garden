#+title: Atomic Habits

 * Basically, focus on the process, or the direction, not the destination.
 * You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your
   systems.
 * Pointing and calling as a way to explicitly name habits, good or bad.
 * 1st law of behaviour change: *make it obvious*
   * Can schedule a time and a place.  Or you can *stack the habit* on
     another habit if that habit is consistent.
   * Environment matters.  Make the cues of good habits obvious in your
     environment.
   * Easier to build new habits in a new environment.
   * The secret to self-control is to not be in tempting situations in the
     first place.
 * 2nd law of behaviour change: *make it attractive*
   * Habits are dopamine driven
   * Anticipating a reward causes the dopamine spike, not the getting of it.
   * Try temptation bundling.  Combine a needed task with a wanted task.
   * We emulate habits of family, friends, the powerful.
   * Join a culture where the normal behaviour is your desired behaviour.
     You'll want to do the right thing just to fit in.
   * Habits are modern day solution to ancient desires (Facebook isn't about
     likes, it's about social acceptance).
   * Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately
     before a difficult habit.   
 * 3rd law of behaviour change is *make it easy*.
   * Practice not planning
   * Number of repetitions is more important than length of time (which is
     possibly why my Spanish is still really bad, despite the DuoLingo)
   * We naturally to the option that requires the least effort
   * Create environment where the right thing is the easy thing (unplug TV
     when you don't want to watch it, sprinkle books around your house so
     you can read without effort
   * Small habits (decisions) shape your day.
   * Two minute rule: when you start a new habit it should take less than
     two minutes, and you should ritualize the start of it (i.e. putting on
     exercise clothes to work out).  Start by just reading a single page a
     day if you want to be a good reader.
   * Inversion: make bad habits difficult
   * Use commitment devices, which lock in your future behaviour (Victor
     Hugo told his maid to hide all his clothes so he couldn't go out, only
     write)
   * Automating habits is the best way (automatic savings plan)
 * 4th law of behaviour change: *make it satisfying*
   * Make it immediately satisfying, since this is how our brains work.
   * Use habit tracking, maybe by marking an X on a calendar each time you
     exercise.
   * Don't break the chain.  Keep your streak alive.
     * Desmond: As an aside, not sure how effective this is at learning
       Spanish on DuoLingo.
   * Be very careful of letting the number become the goal.
   * Inversion: make bad habit unsatisfying.
   * Use an accountability to shame you into keeping you on track.
   * Use a habit contract, signed by people you know, to add a social cost
     to breaking the habit.
   * Knowing that someone is watching you can motivate.
