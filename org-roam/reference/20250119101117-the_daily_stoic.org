#+title: The Daily Stoic

According to Ryan Holiday, Stoicism is about focusing your effort on what's
under your control.

When faced with the hardships of the world, you can't really control what
comes your way, but you can control your perception of these things.  Your
opinions of them.

The book is structured as a series of daily Stoic quotes, and ruminations on
them by Holiday.

I'm not sure I fully accept the premise.  It's seems very difficult to just
kind of accept the bad things that are happening to you.  That being said,
being calm under pressure sounds great.

And I don't think that the Stoics would advocate just doing nothing in the
face of adversity - you *can* do things when bad things come your way, this
*is* under your control.
