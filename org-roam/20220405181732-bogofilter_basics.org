#+title: Bogofilter basics
#+filetags: :email:

I use bogofilter with procmail to counteract [[id:aaaefce4-768c-4609-ade9-4c22e093e7aa][email]] spam.  There's a good web
page here: http://pubpages.unh.edu/notes/bogofilter.html

To use bogofilter effectively, you need two things:

 * a large bunch of emails that are known to be spam.
 * a large bunch of emails that are known to be ham (i.e. legitimate emails)

You need to register all this email as spam or ham with bogofilter so it can
build up its ''word lists''.  Then, when another email comes in, bogofilter
consults its word lists to determine whether the new email is spam or ham.

If you tell it to, bogofilter will insert an appropriate header (X-Bogosity)
with an indication of the chances that the email in question is spam.  You
can then use the third-party tools of your choosing to act on this
information.  I use procmail myself (See Procmail Integration).

Let's say you have all you junk mail in a maildir called Junk.  You can then
run the following in the directory where your Junk mail resides:

#+begin_src 
bogofilter -s -B Junk
#+end_src

The -s options means to register as spam.  The -B options tells bogofilter
to register the "objects" listed on the command line.  In the above example,
the object is a maildir box/folder.  bogofilter knows enough about the
maildir format to register the emails in the folder correctly.

For the rest of your legitimate emails, register them as ham.  You'll need
to provide all your folder/mailboxes on the command line:

#+begin_src 
bogofilter -n -B INBOX INBOX.mailing-list01 INBOX.mailing-list02
#+end_src

The -n tells bogofilter to register as ham.

If your only spam maildir is named Junk, and the rest of your maildirs are
ham, you can do this:

#+begin_src 
$ cd ~/Mail # wherever your mail folder are
$ ls | grep -v Junk | xargs bogofilter -n -B
#+end_src

bogofilter stores its word lists under ~/.bogofilter.  If you ever want to
recompute your word lists, you can delete the contents of ~/.bogofilter and
start again.

** Procmail Integration

Bogofilter will insert an X-Bogosity header into the emails it classifies if
you tell it to.  My procmail setup takes advantage of this to dump spam into
a special folder.


#+begin_src 
#### start spam conditions
:0fw
| bogofilter -e -p --spam-cutoff=0.95

:0e
{ EXITCODE=75 HOST }

:0
,* ^X-Bogosity: Spam, tests=bogofilter
Junk/
#### end spam conditions
#+end_src


The -p (passthrough) option to bogofilter tells it to tack on the X-Bogosity
to the email.

The -e will cause bogofilter to exit with a 0 on success, instead of
different statuses depending on the classification results.  This simplifies
procmail integration.

The --spam-cutoff option tells bogofilter that all emails with a spam score
higher then this will be considered spam.
