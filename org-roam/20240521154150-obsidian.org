Software for [[id:CAA54188-C8EF-4204-AB47-90A27514E2E8][PIM]] or [[id:E9DDE472-8D71-4547-992C-56D16AE6A5E5][digital gardens]].  Can be used like [[id:5942bb24-580d-49b6-a941-28c172b4d7b5][org-roam]].  Uses
Markdown files on the backend.

This software fulfills the requirements of a [[id:a2e09732-e1f9-4e01-a5fa-74092ae75cd5][text based workflow]], and given
that it has clients for mobile and desktop, etc. it is tempting to use it.

The only down side, if you can call it that, is that you don't use [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]].

I think that if org-roam doesn't pan out, this might be a good alternative.
