#+title: Emacs full text search

I'm writing this with an eye to doing full text search in [[id:5942bb24-580d-49b6-a941-28c172b4d7b5][org-roam]], but I
suppose this is kinda generic as well.

I use [[id:500B5CD1-8C3C-4251-8F44-0EFB22A439C1][ivy]] with org-roam since that's what [[id:f4553ccf-5624-492c-9a55-85962ab15f98][emacs prelude]] seems to have set up
by default, and I find it less instrusive than helm.

Most fast approaches to doing a full text search involve outsources to an
external program.  The ones I've seen to far are ag and ripgrep.

In terms of integration with ivy, we have counsel-ag and cousel-rg.  You
need to install ag and ripgrep respetively for these to work.
