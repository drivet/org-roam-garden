#+title: Yasnippet directory structure

Snippet directories are located in the variable yas-snippet-dirs, which by
default has a single value of ~/emacs.d/snippets, for your personal
snippets.  You can find many snippet collections on the web, and as you add
them to your setup you have to keep adding stuff to the yas-snippet-dirs
variable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; keeping YASnippet defaults try out ~/Downloads/interesting-snippets
(setq yas-snippet-dirs (append yas-snippet-dirs
                               '("~/Downloads/interesting-snippets")))
#+end_src

Under each snippet folder are sub-folders named for the major-modes for
which the snippets apply.
