#+title: Static Site Generator

Static site generators are an old idea that seems to be making a come back
with [[https://jamstack.org/][Jamstack]] and services like [[https://www.netlify.com/][Netlify]].

In the past I've used [[https://github.com/thewml/website-meta-language][WML]] to crank out web pages, which dates back to the
90's.

Currently (2022-04-05) popular examples:

 - [[https://www.11ty.dev/][Eleventy]]
 - [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]]
