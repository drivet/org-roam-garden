[[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]]

Not much to say here except that using hitting enter in the minibuffer is
usually a "go" command, so it's hard to insert the character as a literal
newline.  But...

You can insert things like newlines, TABs, etc by using the C-q key
sequence, followed by the character (C-j for newline for example).  Very
useful if you're using the minibuffer to do a search and replace and you
want to include a newline or TAB for example.
