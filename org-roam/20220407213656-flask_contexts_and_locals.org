#+title: Flask contexts and locals

[[id:39ce030b-7dd0-4f63-abb2-9ef84fc3b131][Flask]]

Flask uses thread locals for its web objects.  So, for example, things like
the current app, the request, etc. are accessed via a global variable that
automatically proxies them - you're always accessing *your* application, in
*your* thread.

The global variables (context locals) are:

 * _request_ctx_stack
 * _app_ctx_stack
 * current_app
 * request
 * session
 * g
