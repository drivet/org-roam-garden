** Adding a new device to a Syncthing cluster

Say you have N devices all sharing data with each other with Syncthing.  How
do you bring the next device (L) into the fold?

 * On L, set up a remote device to one of the devices in the cluster (call
   it R) **with the Introducer flag set**.  I think any device will do here,
   but I guess you could just designate one of them as the "hub" device.
 * On R, you should get a notification that L is trying to connect.  Say
   yes.
 * Also on R, go into the folders you want to share and make sure to share
   them with the new device L.
 * Eventually the devices that are connected to R already will be added to L
   though the remote R introducer.
