#+title: Adjusting Photograph Levels

Fairly good article:

https://digital-photography-school.com/take-control-contrast-using-curves-levels-photoshop/

The idea behind levels is that you arbitrarily make a function that maps
input pixels to output pixels, by adding points on a curve that you can move
around.

Steeper curve means more contrast.  Moving the curve lower means values are
mapped to darker values, higher means lighter.
