This is another decent key lime bar recipe, that's a bit simpler and more
tangy than the Little Spice Jar version, with a slightly thinner base.

Yield: 16 squares

** Ingredients

 * 1 cup finely ground graham cracker crumbs
 * 2 1/2 tablespoons finely ground graham cracker crumbs
 * 1/3 cup sugar
 * 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
 * 3 large egg yolks
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated lime zest
 * 2/3 cup fresh Key lime juice , (about 23 Key limes total)
 * 1 cup sweetened condensed milk, (14 ounces)
 * 2 Key limes, thinly sliced into half-moons

** Instructions

Make crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir together graham cracker
crumbs, sugar, and butter in a small bowl. Press evenly onto bottom of an
8-inch square glass baking dish. Bake until dry and golden brown, about 10
minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack.(Leave oven on.)

Make filling: Put egg yolks and lime zest in the bowl of an electric mixer
fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on high speed until very thick, about
5 minutes. Reduce speed to medium. Add condensed milk in a slow, steady
stream, mixing constantly. Raise speed to high; mix until thick, about 3
minutes. Reduce speed to low. Add lime juice; mix until just combined.

Spread filling evenly over crust using a spatula. Bake, rotating dish
halfway through, until filling is just set, about 10 minutes. Let cool
completely on a wire rack. Refrigerate at least 4 hours (or overnight).

Cut into 2-by-2-inch bars. Garnish bars with whipped cream and a slice of
lime.
