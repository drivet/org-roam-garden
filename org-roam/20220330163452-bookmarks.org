#+title: Bookmarks

What I want from my bookmarks:

- always available on every device
- easy to follow the bookmark
- easy to add a bookmark
- easy to see what the bookmark is about at a glance
- (maybe) easy to delete bookmark

Things I don't really care about

- sharing.  My bookmarks are pretty much for me.

Availability and ease of adding could be done with just a text file on
[[id:074766bc-7479-4cba-a01a-5e96aa3e22e9][Dropbox]].  I could literally just use org-mode to manage my bookmarks.

But it would be bit hard to follow links on a phone though (but maybe look
at [[http://www.orgzly.com/][orgzly]]).  A plain text file also makes seeing info about the bookmark
difficult.

So we have the web page (app) solution, which solves all of it, except the
easy deletion since I'm dealing with a [[id:d71ffb6c-8147-4f97-8044-1e71f5819926][static site generator]].

Bookmarks are a bit special in my case because I would often like to see a
list of them, more often then other kinds of [[id:f9b01190-b396-4e6a-a912-83167d33968d][indieweb]] posts. So I need a way
pick them out of my feed.  Options:

- keep them in a separate folder.  This may actually make sense for bookmarks.
- use [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][emacs]] or some utility tool to pick them out of my feed
