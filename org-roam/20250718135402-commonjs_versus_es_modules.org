#+title: CommonJS versus ES Modules

These are competing [[id:de508103-e007-4aa0-8bfc-a290428f543f][Javascript]] module systems.

In the beginning there was CommonJS.  This is the old, familiar module
system that they used on Node.  You recognize it by the all the ~require~
calls at the top of your file and the ~module.exports~ section at the
bottom.


ES(6?) modules are the newer Javascript standard.  They are supported in Node
past version 8, but not by default.  You have to turn them on by either:

 * Using an *.mjs extension or
 * Using ~type: module~ in your package.json.

Pretty simple, actually.  It's when you add [[id:f9046198-ca6b-4891-9744-ecd9bb6d2bb1][Typescript]] to the mix that
things get super hairy.
