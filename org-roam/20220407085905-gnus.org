A newsreader and [[id:33af9cb5-9bf4-42ab-a140-cbe4b1078525][email client for Emacs]]

[[id:436197ee-3978-474a-aa6d-373d0cfd2d67][Gnus]] can be difficult to use, especially if you can't remember the
keybindings (you could say that about all of [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]]).  This page is here to
remind me of the most widely used keybindings and to have a central place
for useful links.

** Vocabulary and Model

Gnus uses a somewhat specialized vocabulary.  It's important that one knows
it (somewhat) before trying to configure Gnus.  Everything is an uphill
battle otherwise.

The main thing to remember is that is Gnus was designed primarily as a
newsreader.  All the terms Gnus uses tend to revolve around that idea.  Yes,
you can use Gnus to read your email effectively, but because Gnus is
primarily a newsreader, the email concepts tend to get expressed in
"newsreader" terms.

So where Gnus uses the term "server", it usually means "news server".  News
servers have lists of news groups that you can subscribe to.  Each group has
a list of messages that you can view and can, potentially, be posted to.
Gnus uses the term "select method" interchangably with this concept of
"server".  It's important to understand this message model when it comes
time to configure email.

So, servers, have groups, and groups have messages.  In email, groups of
messages are called "folders" but not in Gnus.  Since Gnus treats everything
like news, folders of messages are called "groups", just like Usenet. The
root of all your email groups is the "server" or "select method".  So, if
you have a bunch of maildir folders, the root directory of that bunch of
maildir folders is what Gnus would call the "server" or "select method",
since this is the corresponding email concept - it's the entity which
logically contains all the groups (folders) you want to read.

Finally, servers have backends.  This tells Gnus how to actually read the
email/news.
