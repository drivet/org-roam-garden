Quite easy to make, but long.  Very tasty, but not my favourite.

Yield: 4 servings

** Ingredients

 * 1/4 cup olive oil
 * 3 yellow onions, thinly sliced
 * 4 garlic cloves, minced
 * 8 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced
 * 1 tbsp fresh thyme
 * 1/2 cup dry white wine
 * 2 tbsp all purpose flour
 * 2 cups beef broth (or vegetable broth)
 * 2 cups water
 * 12 oz dried orecchiette or other short cut pasta
 * 1 tbsp sherry vinegar
 * Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
 * Fresh herbs and toasted breadcrumbs for serving (optional)

** Instructions

Heat oil over a large skillet over medium heat. When shimmering, add the
onions and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently until deeply
caramelized. About 25-30 minutes.

Pour in the beef stock (or vegetable stock) and water. Season with salt and
freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a boil then add the pasta and cook for
8-10 minutes or until al dente. (Keep in mind that other pasta shapes will
have different cook times).

Add the garlic, mushrooms and thyme. Saut√© for 3-4 minutes or until the
mushrooms begin to soften. Add the wine to deglaze the pan and add the
flour. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until thickened.

Turn off the heat and stir in the sherry vinegar. Serve warm.
