#+title: Open Graph Description and IndieWeb Summary

I used Bridgy to syndicate my [[id:f9b01190-b396-4e6a-a912-83167d33968d][IndieWeb]] content to Twitter.  It prefers the
following bits of content, in order:

 * summary
 * content
 * name

You can also choose to include the link or not.  I include the link for
articles, but not for notes.  This matters because when you include the
link, the destination site will unfurl that link and use the metadata tags.
   
When I'm posting a note via Bridgy, I want the whole content to be shared.
When posting an article, I want a "description" to be shared, and it
shouldn't be an excerpt of the post because that will get displayed in the
URL card.

So, for a post, the summary should be a separate piece of content.  I _also_
don't want the summary to actually show up on my post.  So I put the summary
as a "display: none" div.

When sharing my articles, I also want the summary to be the Open Graph
description, so I put that in the og:description metadata.

Notes don't really have explicit summaries, but I could probably put a
synthetic one like "Note from <date>".  Or just don't put anything at all.
