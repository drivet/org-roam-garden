[[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]]

The mark is used in Emacs to define a selection.  If you combine this with
the (occasionally sophisticated) command for moving around then you can
select semantic bits of text.

 * C-SPC will set the mark.
 * C-g will unset the mark (and some commands will unset it automatically)
