#+title: Emacs help

[[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] has an online help system.

I've installed [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful]] to make it better.

C-h b will display the keybindings available.  Good with [[id:1fefcf17-8851-477e-89b1-ab0f3f436900][Dired]] since it
doesn't really show what you can do in an obvious way
