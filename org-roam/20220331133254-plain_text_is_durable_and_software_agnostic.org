#+title: Plain text is durable and software agnostic

One of the reasons I like writing my blog entries in plain text is that
plain text is durable.  ASCII has been around since the 60's and every piece
of writing software in existence has handle it, and will continue to handle
it.  Thus, plain text is durable and [[id:a8414195-5b63-44f3-a8de-dbddb6d2f1f3][software agnostic]] (maybe it's the same
idea?).

Software agnosticism is the reason I [[https://desmondrivet.com/2018/11/18/photo-organization][organize my photos]] the way I do.  I
like being able to re-generate my albums with simple tools.
