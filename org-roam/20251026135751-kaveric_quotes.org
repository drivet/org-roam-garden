#+title: Kavaeric quotes

Kavaeric is a guy on Twitter.  He wrote this:

#+begin_quote
The winter is dark and harsh with stinging cold. They spread salt over the
roads. It poisons water and eats metal, and they tell you now it is safe.
#+end_quote

The post apparently isn't there anymore, so my Indieweb like doesn't point
to anything.  Rather than keep it there I copied the quote here because I
like it.
