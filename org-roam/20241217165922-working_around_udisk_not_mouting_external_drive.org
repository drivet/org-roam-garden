#+title: Working around udisk not mouting external drive

[[id:9b39db1c-a987-4a6f-8d3b-4d0cc2596867][Linux Administration]]

Linux Mint 22, at some point, would recognize my external USB drive, but
would not mount it.

The system is supposed to be using udisk.  It's supposed to recognize when
the disk was connected and dynamically create the mount point in /media/dcr/

Even though the device would appear in my Nemo window, I'd get a missing
folder error, as if the system knew it was supposed to create the mount
point, but refused to, and then complained when it wasn't there.

Here's a way to get around it for now.

First get the UUID of the unmounted disk.  I used the Disks application.
It's 84405FA1405F98AE in my case.

Then create a folder under /mount/dcr:
#+begin_src
cd /media/dcr
mkdir backups03
#+end_src

Add this to /etc/fstab (tab after each column):

#+begin_src 
UUID=84405FA1405F98AE /media/dcr/backups03      ntfs    defaults        0       1    
#+end_src
