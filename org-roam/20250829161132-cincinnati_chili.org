This one comes from my friend JB.  I know that Cincinnati Chili can be
controversial but I'm an unapologetic fan.  The trick is to manage your
expectations - this is not Tex Mex chili, but rather its own thing
entirely. If you imagine this dish as an exotically flavoured meat-based
spaghetti sauce, you'll do much better.

** Ingredients

 * 4 cups water
 * 2 lbs ground beef, browned
 * 2 large onions, chopped fine
 * 1 whole clove garlic
 * 1 6 oz can tomato paste
 * 2 Tbsp chili powder
 * 1 Tbsp salt
 * 1 1/2 tsp allspice
 * 1 1/2 tsp black pepper
 * 1 tsp cinnamon
 * 1/2 tsp cumin
 * 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
 * 3 whole bay leaves
 * 1 1/2 Tbsp white vinegar
 * 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
  
** Instructions


Place all ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover
and simmer for 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Serve over spaghetti with
finely chopped raw onion, small red beans and finely grated, mild (orange)
cheddar cheese.

*** Added Wisdom

I use <mi-maigre> ground beef browned just until the redness of the ground
beef is gone in a deep skillet. While the beef is cooking, I break it up as
much as I can with a spatula to eliminate any chunks and get the beef as
granular as possible. I then remove the beef to the cooking pot with a
slotted spoon so some of the juices are retained but most of the fat is left
in the skillet.

I cook the chili in a broad-bottomed, 5 qt. pot. I bring the chili to boil
on a large electric burner and then transfer it to a smaller burner for
simmering—I find the heat easier to regulate that way. I try to get a steady
<localized> simmer where it is bubbling in a couple places but not over the
entire surface area. Covering the chili during the simmer is important, as
is allowing the condensation on the underside of the lid to run back into
the chili—otherwise the chili reduces too much.

After 3 hours, the chili develops a resiliency where if you hit the chili
with the back of a spoon it bounces back. Once you've done a batch you'll
know what I mean. It should not be watery and it should not splatter like
spaghetti sauce. Nor should it syrupy.

I usually use large white onions, chopped as fine as I can reasonably get
them. I use the Clic brand of canned small red beans, just rinsed in cold
water and drained. Any brand of mild cheddar cheese will do—I find the
generic cheese harder to grate, but it melts better into the chili. Any
brand of spaghetti will also work. The spaghetti should be fully cooked or
just slightly al dente—it should be soft enough to absorb the chili juices.
