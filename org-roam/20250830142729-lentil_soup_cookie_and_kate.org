A little heavy on the tomato but still pretty good.

Yield: 4 servings

** Ingredients

 * 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
 * 1 medium yellow or white onion, chopped
 * 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
 * 4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced
 * 2 teaspoons ground cumin
 * 1 teaspoon curry powder
 * 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
 * 1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes, drained
 * 1 cup brown or green lentils, picked over and rinsed
 * 4 cups vegetable broth
 * 2 cups water
 * 1 teaspoon salt, more to taste
 * Pinch red pepper flakes
 * Freshly ground black pepper
 * 1 cup chopped fresh collard greens or kale, tough ribs removed
 * Juice of 1/2 to 1 medium lemon, to taste

** Instructions


Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. One-fourth
cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and
heartiness to this nutritious soup.

Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook,
stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent,
about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until
fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained
diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to
enhance their flavor.

Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of
red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Raise
heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot and
reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, or until the
lentils are tender but still hold their shape.  Transfer 2 cups of the soup
to a blender. Protect your hand from steam with a tea towel placed over the
lid and purée the soup until smooth. Pour the puréed soup back into the pot
and add the chopped greens. Cook for 5 more minutes, or until the greens
have softened to your liking.

Remove the pot from heat and stir in the juice of half of a lemon. Taste and
season with more salt, pepper and/or lemon juice until the flavors really
sing. Serve immediately. Leftovers will keep well for about 4 days in the
refrigerator, or can be frozen for several months (just defrost before
serving).
