Yasnippet is a templating system for [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]].  You type an abbreviation
followed by an expansion key (usually TAB) and you get the expanded text.

Abbreviations are defined in snippet files, and are made available on a per
major mode basis.

Read the documentation for how to write a snippet. You basically just create
points in your file where the TAB key will bring you as you fill in the
fields.
