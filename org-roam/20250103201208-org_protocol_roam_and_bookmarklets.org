#+title: Org protocol, roam and bookmarklets

Briefly, this is how capturing bookmarks from a web browser works with [[id:4e639dc7-567a-408b-9ec1-c3f958958952][org
roam]]

Say your web browser is on the URL you want to bookmark.  First you write a
bookmarklet that looks like this:

#+begin_src 
javascript:location.href =
    'org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='
    + encodeURIComponent(location.href)
    + '&title='
    + encodeURIComponent(document.title)
    + '&body='
    + encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())
#+end_src

This tells the browser to navigate to a URL with a protocol that looks like
org-protocol, hence the setting of the location.href in the javascript.

(This will replace the contents of the page you're trying to bookmark with
an org-protocol "page".  How can we avoid that?  Maybe launch a new window
for the org-protocol URL?)

The usual way to process these types of specialized protocols is to hand off
the URL to a specialized app.  For example, magnet URLs could be handed off
to [[https://transmissionbt.com/][transmission]].

This usually requires some desktop configuration desktop configuration.  On
Linux, for example, this involves using a XDG compliant Desktop environment
and creating a desktop file.  In our case we want org-protocol to be handled
by emacsclient.  From the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol entry on worg]]:

#+begin_quote
Create an org-protocol.desktop file either in ~/.local/share/applications/
to set-up emacsclient as the org-protocol handler for the current user or in
/usr/share/applications to set-up a system-wide configuration:
#+end_quote

#+begin_src
[Desktop Entry]
Name=org-protocol
Comment=Intercept calls from emacsclient to trigger custom actions
Categories=Other;
Keywords=org-protocol;
Icon=emacs
Type=Application
Exec=emacsclient -- %u
Terminal=false
StartupWMClass=Emacs
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol;
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
Update the cache database of MIME types handled by desktop files via:
#+end_quote

~update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/~

(How do you do this on a system that using a non-XDG window manager?  I have
no idea)

Using org-protocol requires using a sub-protocol in the first part of the
URL.  The one used here is roam-ref, which will automatically insert a
ROAM_REFS variable into the PROPERTIES of the new node it creates.  The URL
allows you to pick a template by letter, like one normally does with
org-capture, but if you just choose 'r' you'll get the default template
defined in ~org-roam-capture-ref-templates~.  In my case I like adding a
create date, so my template looks like this:

#+begin_src
(setq org-roam-capture-ref-templates
      '(("r" "ref" plain "%?" :target
         (file+head "${slug}.org" "#+date: %U\n#+title: ${title}")
         :unnarrowed t)))
#+end_src
