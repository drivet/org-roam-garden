** The decline of email

Email isn't used as much nowadays (2024) given that most people will
communicate via chat applications (WhatsApp, Signal) or social networking
apps (Twitter).  Or via chat apps from social networks (Facebook Messanger).
Or even simple cell phone texting.

Still, email is good for people who don't have social media.
