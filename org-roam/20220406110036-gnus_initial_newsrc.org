Reading news involves managing a newsrc file. This file contains all the
groups you are subscribed/unsubscribed to.

Gnus doesn't create a big newsrc file. It will create a really small one
with just a group or two.

It can be confusing when all you see are just a few groups. I don't know
where they all go. The docs say they're all killed, but a A k won't bring
them up. I'm stumped.
