#+title: Emacs Prelude

Emacs Prelude is an [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] distribution that aims to make the out of the box
Emacs experience a bit more pleasant.

Compared to something like Spacemacs or Doom, it's a lot lighter and doesn't
try to fundamentally change how Emacs works.
