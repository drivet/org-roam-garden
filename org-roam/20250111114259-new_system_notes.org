[[id:9b39db1c-a987-4a6f-8d3b-4d0cc2596867][Linux Administration]]

Notes for when I install a new Linux system (instructions here may be Mint
specific)

Don't bother creating partitions for boot or home.  One partition for root
is fine especially with SSDs.
   
Install the following packages:
 * Spotify (go to https://www.spotify.com/us/download/linux/)
 * Emacs
 * Signal ([[https://signal.org/download/#][download]] from signal website. follow instructions)
 * [[id:8c446971-340b-40c4-be3a-eee7e9049a28][Syncthing]] (install it from [[https://apt.syncthing.net/][their repository]])
 * [[id:074766bc-7479-4cba-a01a-5e96aa3e22e9][Dropbox]] (install it from [[https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux][this page]], using the Ubuntu deb file)
   * Need to install gir1-gtk for the newer Dropbox packages to work
 * Docker (look at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
   * And set up so that we can [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48957195/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-issue][run docker as non-root]] (bottom line is to add
     your user to the docker group, creating it if it's not there)

Install these on Desktop only:
 * Digikam from [[id:f5a3e676-3c4b-4bb3-8a99-b10c9d77b195][flatpak]] since it seems to be more up to date
 * Gimp
 * rsnapshot

[[id:be1bbffe-c05b-4c99-8bbe-00b0f35cf5ac][Set up SSH keys]] so that I can log into my remote VPS.

Start the following services when you start (using Startup Applications on
Linux Mint):

 * Syncthing
 * Dropbox (done automatically when you install the deb file)
 * Emacs server (/usr/bin/emacs --daemon)
