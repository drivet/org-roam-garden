#+title: Line numbers in Emacs

You can get line numbers in [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] several ways.

In the past this was accomplished with linum-mode.  In recent versions of
emacs, we have nlinum-mode, which is used by [[id:f4553ccf-5624-492c-9a55-85962ab15f98][Emacs Prelude]].  I think the
latter is supposed to be faster.

Most recently, emacs has this built in with display-line-number-mode, which
should probably be the go version moving forward.
