** Big Brother Database (BBDB) Basics

At the moment I use the [[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bbdb/][Big Brother Database]] (BBDB) for [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] to manage my
contacts.  This page is for remembering basic keystrokes.

(Note that the above link is for BBDB v3 and the info here may be wrong)

 * M-x bbdb to search bbdb.  Just press * or enter to get all records.
 * M-x bbdb-create to create a new entry, or c to create a new entry while
   on the bbdb result screen
 * e to edit a field (depending on point location)
 * d to delete a record or field (depending on point location)
 * C-o to add a new field
