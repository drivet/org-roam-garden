Extremely rich Millionaire Shortbread recipe (like a homemade Twix bar).
Usually a crowd pleaser, but maybe a bit too much caramel.  I should try
this with half the caramel, for a thinner layer.

Yield: 28 servings

** Ingredients

*** Shortbread Crust

 * 1 cup unsalted butter, softened (226g)
 * 1/3 cup sugar (70g)
 * 1/3 cup light brown sugar, packed (70g)
 * 1 large egg yolk
 * 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
 * 1/2 teaspoon salt
 * 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (260g)
   
*** Caramel
 * 2 14-oz cans sweetened condensed milk (792g)
 * 14 Tablespoons unsalted butter cut into Tablespoon-sized pieces (198g)
 * 1 cup light brown sugar packed (200g)
 * 1/3 cup light corn syrup (80ml)
 * 3/4 teaspoon salt
 * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

*** Chocolate Ganache
 * 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (340g)
 * 1/2 cup heavy cream, (120 ml)
 * sea salt for sprinkling
   
** Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F (177C) and line a 13x9 baking pan with parchment paper.

Using an electric mixer, beat butter until well creamed.

Add sugars and beat until light and fluffy, about 30 seconds.

Add egg yolk and vanilla extract and stir well, pausing to scrape down the
sides and mixing until ingredients are well-combined.

Add flour, gradually (about Â½ cup at a time), pausing to scrape down sides
of bowl. Halfway through the addition of the flour, sprinkle in the salt
with the beater still running. Don't over-beat the dough, you want it to be
slightly crumbly to make it easier to press into the pan.

Drop dough over prepared pan and gently, firmly, evenly, press dough into
the bottom of the pan.  To make it easier, I usually lay a piece of wax
paper over the dough and use the palm of my hand to smooth the surface (and
then discard wax paper).

Bake on 350F (177C) for 20-25 minutes -- edges should be lightly golden
brown.

Allow to cool while you prepare your caramel topping.

*** Caramel

Combine condensed milk, butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt in a
medium-sized saucepan over medium heat.

Stir frequently until butter is melted and ingredients are
well-combined. Continue to stir constantly until mixture begins to boil
(this could take several minutes, but you don't need to increase the heat).

Once mixture comes to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer (slowly bubbling),
still stirring constantly.  Continue to stir 10-15 minutes until mixture
turns a rich caramel color and has thickened (should begin pulling away from
the sides of the pot as you stir). If using a candy thermometer, the caramel
should reach 225F (107C)

Remove from heat and immediately stir in the vanilla extract.

Pour evenly over prepared shortbread, use a knife to spread evenly if
needed.

Allow to cool at room temperature for several hours or in the refrigerator
for 1 hour before topping with chocolate.

*** Chocolate Topping

Combine chocolate chips and heavy cream in a small saucepan over low heat.

Stir frequently until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.

Remove from heat and allow chocolate to cool just slightly for about 5
minutes, and then evenly spread over prepared caramel layer.  Wait several
minutes/until chocolate begins to set and then sprinkle with sea salt.

Allow chocolate to harden (I recommend placing in refrigerator for about 30
minutes -- my family prefers these treats refrigerated anyway) before
cutting and serving.
