#+title: ActivityPub and Interoperation

[[id:41030673-ce20-4b49-ad4c-6967db65c066][ActivityPub]] is supposed to allow content from one users activity feed to
show up in another

I can see roughly what this means for Mastodon instances.  You toot and then
you push those toots to other servers.

It's easy to imagine when we're dealing with the same applications.  But
what about different applications?  What about Mastodon and [[https://join-lemmy.org/][Lemmy]] (a Reddit
clone)?

A good article about it is here:

https://vijayprema.com/using-lemmy-from-my-existing-mastodon/

Basically you can

 * Post to Lemmy by posting to Mastodon and @ mention the group you want to
   post to.  First line becomes the title of the post
 * Reply to a Lemmy post: Get the direct link to the Lemmy post/comment
   using its "rainbow Fediverse" link button in Lemmy, paste it into your
   logged in Mastodon instance search bar, and then press Reply and post
   your reply.

See here:

According to some sources, you can follow Bookwyrm users from your Mastodon
instance and you'll see their updates in your feed.  This appears to be
because BookWyrm convert their custom object types into standard ones when
send updates to non-bookwyrm instances.

Shows how Bookwyrm maps to ActivityPub:

Bookwyrn uses special Object types that get converted to standard ones when
they go out.
