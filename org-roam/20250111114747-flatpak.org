[[id:9b39db1c-a987-4a6f-8d3b-4d0cc2596867][Linux Administration]]

A package manager on Linux, usually running alongside the distributions
package manager.

Good summary here:

https://www.howtogeek.com/902275/what-is-a-flatpak-in-linux-and-how-do-you-install-one/

Key features include:
 * Sandboxing
 * More up-to-date applications

I use it to install something like digikam because it's a KDE app and I
don't really want to install all the KDE dependencies via apt.  With
flatpak, the dependencies are installed as part of the app itself, kind of
like how npm does it.
