 * Monitor mode button is next to the viewfinder.  Looks like an eye.
   Cycles through different ways that the monitor and viewfinder operate
   together.
 * Has custom function buttons near the lens.  Set them to what you like.

   (Controls), then Custom controls (shooting)
 * Vibration reduction (like image stabilization but through the lens) is
   through the Photo shooting menu, it seems to be on by default.
