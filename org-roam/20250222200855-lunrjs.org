Lunrjs is a [[id:de508103-e007-4aa0-8bfc-a290428f543f][Javascript]] based full text search library.

When you use in a static site context, it's meant to run in the browser.

It can operate in two modes:

 * with a straightforward json file on your content.  This json file isn't
   an index or really processed - the library itself will create the index
   from the file.
 * with a prebuilt index, created from the aforementioned json file


The index file tends to be bigger and hence takes longer to download.  But
you at least save the indexing time on the client.  It's hard to really know
if the extra size is worth it.

The first way is definitely simpler because the json is really just a
particular way of outputting your content.  It's almost analogous to an RSS
or a Atom feed.
