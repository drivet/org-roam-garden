#+title: Accessibility Privacy Matrix

A matrix of information accessibility (in terms of device sharing) and
privacy (in terms of who can see the data).

** Not accessible and private

This means you're just working on one computer.  Any software will do here,
though text file based software is better for portability.  You can use
[[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] or [[id:D9D40756-298A-42D4-B548-2D57263688E9][Obsidian]] here.

** Accessible and private

You want to access your data on multiple devices, like a laptop and cell
phone, but you don't want ther people to see it (for example, phone
numbers).

This does not have to be web based, but CAN be, if it's a private account on
a web application like Todoist or Roam Research.

But you can also use can use text files here, and something like [[id:074766bc-7479-4cba-a01a-5e96aa3e22e9][Dropbox]] or
Syncthing to share the files between devices.

Examples: my BBDB contact data, my TODO list, email.

** Public

Public, in this case, means anyone can see it, and this implies
accessibility - public and inaccesibility isn't really a thing.  You want
this if, for example, you want to give some of your data to your friends,
like a recipe or a book review.

My blog is definitly public - it's meant for public consumption.  That's the
whole point.

You would also use this category if your data is nominally private, but if
you actually don't mind it being public.  This would describe my digital
garden.  The notes are "private" in that they are specific to me, but it's
not like I *mind* people reading them and in some cases I *want* people to
(like my recipes).

This can be just a website, even with data that is nominally "accessible and
private".  Org-roam, for example, should have a way of publishing the notes
to a website.
