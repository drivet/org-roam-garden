#+title: Cloud authentication and authorization

In [[id:1c4f174b-9327-4a88-b896-741934a48210][GCP]] we manage authorization and authentication via the (Identity Access
and Management) IAM system.  This should work similarly for most cloud
providers.

* Model

GCP has resources, like buckets, Pubsub subscription topics, BigQuery, etc.
You can do various things with these resources, i.e. you can read items off
a bucket or put items in a bucket.

Some people, applications, etc. may need to do some things and not others.
So we can manage that with IAM.

 * *Permission*.  This is a "thing you can do", like read a file on a
   bucket, etc.  You generally don't deal with these directly.  Instead, you
   group these into roles.
 * *Role*.  This is a collection of "things you can do" to or with a cloud
   resource, i.e. permissions.  You could have a "Bucket RW" role that lets
   you read and write items to a bucket, but also an admin role that gives
   you permission to read/write/delete.  A [[id:452805d5-6c0b-4cb1-a8b5-cb1955adc50c][CSP]] will often have a bunch of
   canned roles for you to use, but you can generally make your own.
 * *Principal* or *Members* or *Accounts*.  These are like "people", but
   they can also be applications or machines.  In the past, I used to think
   of these as "users", but the concept is a bit broader than that and
   includes things like apps, etc.

* What is a Service Account?

A *Service account* is a special type of principal (in the past we called
these "users") that we use to access resources on behalf of a application.
In the past, I used to call these "application users", but "service account"
appears to be the new way of referring to this concept.

When you want an application to interact with a bucket, for example, you
generally have to:

 * create a service account for that application.
 * add roles to that service account (not permissions).  Roles carry the
   permission with them.
