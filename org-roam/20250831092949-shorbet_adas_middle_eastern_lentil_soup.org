Healthy, tasty, and easy.  Lots of versions around the Internet, but this
one is mine

Yield: 6 servings

** Ingredients

 * 1 medium onion, diced
 * 1 carrot, diced
 * 2 cloves garlic, minced
 * 1 cup red lentils
 * 1 medium potato, peeled and diced
 * juice of 1 lemon
 * 1 tsp cumin
 * 1/2 tsp turmeric
 * 1/2 tsp ground ginger
 * 1/2 tsp salt + pinch
 * 1/4 tsp black pepper + pinch
 * 6 cups vegetable broth
 * 2 tbsp olive oil

** Instructions

Add olive oil to a big pot.  Turn heat to medium.

When oil starts to shimmer, add onion and carrot and a pinch of salt and
pepper.  Fry for 7 minutes.

Add diced potato and fry for 1 minute.

Add garlic and fry for 30 seconds.

Add cumin, turmeric and ginger and fry for another minute.

Add lentils and fry for another 30 seconds.  Add broth and bring everything
to a boil on high heat.  Once boiling, turn heat to medium low and cover
pot.  Simmer for 15 minutes, until the lentils are soft.

Turn off heat, and with an immersion blender puree the soup until the
texture is creamy but with some chunks still visible.

Add salt, pepper and lemon juice, turn heat back on to medium and simmer for
another minute.
