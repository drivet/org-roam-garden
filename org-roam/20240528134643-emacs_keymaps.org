#+title: Emacs Keymaps

You can think of a keymap in [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] as a collection of keys that are defined
under a particular "namespace", being the keymap name.

You can bind or "mount" the keymap as whole under a particular key (itself
under it's own keymap, maybe just the global one), by binding the function
as you would normally.
