My go to pancake recipe.  Never failed me.

Yield: 4 servings

** Ingredients

 * 2 cups all-purpose flour
 * 1 tablespoon sugar
 * 1 teaspoon salt
 * 1 tablespoon baking powder
 * 2 cups milk (or buttermilk, or a combination of the two, as long as it's about 2 cups)
 * 2 eggs
 * 1/4 cup oil
 * 1 teaspoon of vanilla
  
** Instructions

Mix dry ingredients, then stir in the wet.  Stir until you have little lumps
in an otherwise homogeneous mixture.  Ladle bit by bit onto a frying pan
with non-stick cooking spray.  Cook 1 minute each side on slightly less than
medium heat.
