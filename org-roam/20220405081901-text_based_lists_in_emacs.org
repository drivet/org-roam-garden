#+title: Text based lists in Emacs

* [[id:b9c7e6ff-d14e-4d2d-92bc-414bc2b1577d][Markdown]]
 * Unordered use -, +, *, ordered use <number>.
 * They do not have to be indented (they can be on the first column),
   because headings are different characters (#)

* [[id:FA31BDBE-5F87-4DEE-ABE2-D8AFD52F7D03][Org-Mode]]
 * Unordered use -, +, *, ordered use <number>.
 * They must be indented, since the same characters are use for headers

* [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] Keys
 * Nicely consistent for both modes
 * M-Ret will create a new item in both cases (in org-mode this works for
   headers too)
 * Just enter will continue the current list item, properly indented
 * C-j will exit the list
