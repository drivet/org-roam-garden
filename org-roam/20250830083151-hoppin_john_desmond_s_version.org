This is an amalgamation of various recipes I found on the Internet for
southern black eyed peas.  Can easily be made vegetarian by omitting the
bacon and using vegetable broth.

Yield: 5 servings

** Ingredients

 * 1/2 pound dried black eyed peas (about 2 cups)
 * 1 green pepper, diced
 * 2 ribs celery, diced
 * 1 onion, diced
 * 2 cloves garlic, minced
 * 4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth)
 * 1/3 pound bacon. chopped (or 1/2 tsp liquid smoke)
 * 1 tsp dried thyme
 * 1 tsp dried oregano
 * 1 tsp paprika

** Instructions

Soak the peas overnight.  Discard the water and rinse the peas. Fry the
bacon in a pot until it starts to brown.  Add peppers, onion, celery,
garlic.  Fry for about 3-4 minutes.  Add broth, peas and spice. Cook on
medium, covered, for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until peas are tender.
