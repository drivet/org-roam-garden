This is my preferred key lime bar recipe.

Yield: 16 squares

** Ingredients

 * 1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs (12 large rectangles)
 * 2 tablespoons ground pecans
 * 1/3 cup granulated sugar
 * 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
 * 1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter, melted
 * 3 egg yolks, room temperature
 * 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk
 * 4 teaspoons lime zest (about 3 limes)
 * 1/2 cup key lime juice (regular limes are fine too)

** Instructions

**PREP**: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to
350ºF. Spray an 8x8 square baking pan with cooking spray and line with
parchment paper, set aside.

**CRUST**: In a small bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, ground
pecans, sugar, and cinnamon. Add the melted butter and stir to combine. Make
sure all the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the
baking pan and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven, leave the oven on.

**FILLING**: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk
attachment, whisk the yolks for 2 minutes. Add the condensed milk and
continue to whisk for another 2 minutes. Stop the mixer, scrape down the
sides, add the lime zest. With the mixer on low, drizzle in the lime juice,
let the mixer run for 2 minutes once added. The pie mixture will be slightly
thicker when done. Pour the filling into the crust and bake for 15 minutes.

**SERVE**: Cool completely on wire rack. Filling will set as it
cools. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, and ideally overnight. Slice and
serve chilled.
