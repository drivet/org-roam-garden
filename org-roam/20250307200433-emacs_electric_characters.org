#+title: Emacs Electric Characters

[[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]]

Electric characters are characters that trigger a newline and an indent when
you type them in, like an opening brace or a semicolon.

You used to have to configure CC mode in emacs to get electric characters,
but in emacs 24.1 they introduced electric-indent-mode which I think works
with all sorts of text languages?

The electric characters in ~electric-indent-mode~ will indent the current
line once typed.

Use ~electric-indent-chars~ to control which characters count as electric,
like this:

#+begin_src
(setq electric-indent-chars '(?\n ?;))
#+end_src

The question mark will quote the character as a literal.

Pair this with ~electric-pair-mode~ which will inserts pair of certain
characters, like brackets.
