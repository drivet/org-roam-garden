#+title: Emacs selections

Selections in [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] are interesting, because while you can use the mouse and
drag a selection, you can do somewhat more targeted and sophisticated
operations as well.

It's a tension between very low cognitive load (point-click-drag), but lots
of hand movements, and high cognitive load (selecting a specific semantic
region, so you have to recognize it) and small hand movements which in
theory should be quicker.

So, you can select (and therefore cut or copy) a paragraph by
 * Recognizing you're in a paragraph
 * Using C-up or M-{ to  [[id:bfce90eb-7dee-43af-b09c-2f4062964a69][move to the start of the paragraph.]]
 * C-SPC to set the mark
 * C-down or M-} to move to the end of the paragraph

I'm not convinced that the mouseless way is faster on a desktop, but it's
worth it on a laptop since the mouse is difficult to use.
