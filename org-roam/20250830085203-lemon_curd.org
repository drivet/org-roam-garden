Delectable stuff.  One of my favorite ways to use lemons.  Excellent as a
spread, on oatmeal, over muffins aand scones, on cake, etc.

Yield: 1.5 cups

** Ingredients

 * 3 large eggs
 * 1/3 cup (80 ml) fresh lemon juice (2-3 lemons) (do not use the bottled lemon juice)
 * 1 tablespoon (4 grams) finely shredded lemon zest
 * 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated white sugar
 * 4 tablespoons (56 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature

** Instructions

Note: Room temperature lemons provide more juice.

After squeezing, strain the juice to remove any pulp. Zest is the yellow,
sweet-flavored outer rind of the lemon. A zester or fine grater can be used
to remove the rind. Cold lemons are much easier to grate. Grate lemons just
before using as the zest will lose moisture if it sits too long.

In a stainless steel bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water, whisk
together the eggs, sugar, and lemon juice until blended. Cook, stirring
constantly (to prevent it from curdling), until the mixture becomes thick
(like sour cream or a hollandaise sauce) (160 degrees F or 71 degrees
C). This will take approximately 10 minutes. Remove from heat and
immediately pour through a fine strainer to remove any lumps. Cut the butter
into small pieces and whisk into the mixture until the butter has
melted. Add the lemon zest and let cool. The lemon curd will continue to
thicken as it cools. Cover immediately (so a skin doesn't form) and
refrigerate for up to a week.

Makes 1 1/2 cups (360 ml).

Note: If you want a lighter lemon curd whip 1/2 cup (120 ml) of heavy
whipping cream and fold into the lemon curd.
