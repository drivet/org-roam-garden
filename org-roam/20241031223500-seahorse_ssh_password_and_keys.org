#+title: Seahorse SSH Password and Keys

[[id:9b39db1c-a987-4a6f-8d3b-4d0cc2596867][Linux Administration]]

Seahorse is the GNOME (and Cinnamon) keyring, which managers passwords and
SSH keys.

It will load your private keys into memory, protected by a password which is
the same password you use to log in,

If you set a password on the private key, seahorse will ask you for the
password, and give you the option to unlock the private key at login time.
I think this only has to be done once.
