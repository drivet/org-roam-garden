Yield: 14 slices

** Ingredients

 * 2 1/2 cups (315 g) all-purpose flour
 * 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar
 * 1 cup (200 g) light or dark brown sugar¹ firmly packed
 * 1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
 * 1 teaspoon baking powder
 * 1 teaspoon salt
 * 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
 * 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
 * 1 cup (235 ml) cooking oil use canola, avocado, or vegetable oil
 * 1/2 cup (113 g) unsalted butter melted
 * 4 large eggs room temperature
 * 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
 * 3 cups (340 g) grated carrots² peel before grating
 * 1 cup (125 g) chopped walnuts or pecans optional

** Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F (175C) and prepare two 8-inch pans⁴ (see note for using
different sized pans) by lining the bottoms with parchment paper and lightly
greasing and flouring the sides.

In a large bowl, whisk together your flour, sugars, baking powder, baking
soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

Add your canola oil and melted butter and stir well (batter will be pretty
stiff and thick at this point, I usually use an electric mixer or my stand
mixer to combine everything nicely).

Add eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition.

Stir in vanilla extract.

Stir in carrots and nuts (if using) until ingredients are well-combined.

Evenly divide carrot cake batter into prepared baking pans and bake on 350F
(175C) for 40 minutes (toothpick inserted in center should come out mostly
clean with only few moist crumbs).

Allow cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the
edge and invert onto cooling rack to cool completely.

Allow cake to cool completely before covering with [[id:c0e0d8a9-afc6-46ab-b3d6-3dba1efedeee][Cream Cheese Frosting]]
