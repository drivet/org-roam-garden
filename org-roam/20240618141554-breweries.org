#+title: Breweries

I drink a fair amount of beer, so I suppose it makes sens to keep a record
of different brweries who's products I've tried.

As of 2024, I live in MOntreal, Quebec, and Quebec has a big beer culture,
so a lot of what I've tried is "local" in the sense that it's from Quebec.
Still, I 've tried others too.
