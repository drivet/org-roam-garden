#+title: I blog mostly about blogging

[[id:073f104c-8e48-44a6-8f5f-81e5e89b4881][Blogging]]

When I last checked a large portion of my blog entries were about how I
blog.

I have heard it said that much of Luhmann's zettelkasten was about maintain
the zettelkasten,

There are certain kinds of programmers who enjoy writing software for other
programmers the most.

I'm sure this says something about my reasons for blogging, and about
systems that feed themselves, though I'm not sure what.

I guess I just like the challenge involves in setting up a blogging system.
The mechanics are part of the pleasure of it.
