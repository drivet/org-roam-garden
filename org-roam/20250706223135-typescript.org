** Project structure with tsconfig.json

The ~rootDir~ config defines the root of all source files.  By default this
is the longest common path of all non-declaration input files.

The structure under ~rootDir~ will be preserved in the output directory.
Relative imports are relative to this directory.

The ~include~ config will define more specifically which files should be
included.  You could include all *.ts files here for example.

If ~include~ pulls in files that are not in ~rootDir~, you will get an
error.  But presumably you could stash files under ~rootDir~ that the
~include~ parameters does not pull in, and that would not be an error.
