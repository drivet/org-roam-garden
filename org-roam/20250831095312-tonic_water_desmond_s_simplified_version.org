I based this one off of Jeffrey Morgenthaler's but I cut out a lot of the
ingredients.  I prefer this one because it's simpler and doesn't fight so
much when you pair it with a good gin.

Yield: 4 cups syrup

** Ingredients

 * 4 cups water
 * 1/4 cup cut cinchona bark
 * zest of 1 orange
 * zest of 1 lemon
 * zest of 1 lime
 * 3 Tbsp cup citric acid
 * 1/4 tsp Kosher salt
  
** Instructions

Combine ingredients in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high
heat. Once mixture starts to boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for
20 minutes.  Strain through cheesecloth.
