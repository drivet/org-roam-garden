#+title: Org Mode

Org Mode is a number of things:

 * it's a [[id:a2e09732-e1f9-4e01-a5fa-74092ae75cd5][text format]] for outlining and lists somewhat similar to markdown
 * it's an [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] mode and suite of functions to manipulate and manage that
   format

At first blush it may seem that org mode is not [[id:a8414195-5b63-44f3-a8de-dbddb6d2f1f3][software agnostic]] since it's
heavily associated with Emacs, but I think on further reflection it is
because it's text based.  Emacs is just the most sophiticated software to
manage it but it's still easy to read and manupulate without Emacs.

For example, there exists a [[https://github.com/mooz/org-js/][parser written in Javascript]] for org mode files,
and [[https://pandoc.org][pandoc]] can handle it too.
