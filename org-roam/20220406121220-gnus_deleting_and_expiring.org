#+title: Gnus deleting and expiring

[[id:436197ee-3978-474a-aa6d-373d0cfd2d67][Gnus]]

Deleting only really makes sense in mail groups. B DEL will do a real
delete.

Expiring is something subtly different. Marking a message as expirable
(i.e. with the E mark) means that the message is a candidate for
deletion. It doesn't mean it will get deleted right away, it just means that
it will be deleted in due course. Gnus provides two features to help with
this: auto-expire and total-expire.

auto-expire preserves the meaning of all the marks. Expirable articles are
the ones marked with E, and read one are the ones marked with R, O, etc. But
auto-expire will arrange to press E for you when you select an article. The
marks preserve their semantics (E means expirable, R means read, etc., but
the hitting of the E key is automated.

total-expire, on the other hand, overloads, or changes, the meaning of the
read flags (r, R, O, K, Y) to also mean expirable, in addition to E.
