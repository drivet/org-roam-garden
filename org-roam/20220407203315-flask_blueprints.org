#+title: Flask blueprints

Part of my [[id:39ce030b-7dd0-4f63-abb2-9ef84fc3b131][Flask]] series.

Blueprints seem to be a way to compartmentalize an app into logical pieces.
It seems to be a way of subdividing an app into sub-apps.

Each blueprint (subapp) can have
 * a set of URLs that it handles.
 * its own templates
 * its own static files
