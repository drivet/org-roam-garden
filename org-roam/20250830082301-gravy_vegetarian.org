A pretty decent vegetarian gravy that I make fairly often to go with both
vegetable and meat dishes.  This has been adapted and simplified from
another recipe I found on the Internet.

Yield: 2 cups

** Ingredients

 * 2 cups vegetable broth
 * 2 tbsp butter
 * 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
 * 1 tsp soy sauce
 * 1/8 teaspoon Marmite
 * ground black pepper, to taste

** Instructions

Cook flour and butter together until it's the colour of peanut butter.  Add
broth, soy sauce, marmite, pepper.  Cook uncovered 15 minutes.

Variation: add some sauteed mushrooms and minced fried onion to the broth
before adding it to the roux.
