I usually buy chili powder, but occasionally I'm out, and it's not uncommon
that I'll have the ingredients lying about.

Yield: 2 2/3 Tbsp

** Ingredients

 * 1 Tbsp ground cumin
 * 2 tsp garlic powder
 * 1 tsp cayenne pepper
 * 1 tsp paprika
 * 1 tsp ground oregano

** Instructions

This is an easy chili powder, which tastes pretty similar to the pre-mixed
stuff.  Just mix everything together.

Note that although store bought chili powders usually contain salt, this mix
has none.  So when substituting this powder into your recipes, you may need
to add more salt yourself.
