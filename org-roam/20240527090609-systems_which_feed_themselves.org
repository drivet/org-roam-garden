#+title: Systems which feed themselves

A system which feeds itself is a system which contains, within it, the tools
to grow.  It's like a self replicating machine.

The example I've used in the social sciences is the subject of history - it
feels, sometimes, like it exists solely to produce other history teachers.

And the use of [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]], in the end people spend so much time configuring it
rather than actually using it for anything "outside".

For some programmers, nothing beats writing tools for other programmers.

A good chunk of my blog is about blogging.

A good chuck of people's Zettelkasten are about maintaining and using their
Zettelkasten.
