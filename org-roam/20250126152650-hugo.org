[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] is a static site generator written in [[id:2e9a8432-0079-4155-b60c-d1a8ce60c292][Go]].

Your entire site becomes a Go module, from what I can tell.

Maybe useful links:

 * https://scripter.co/hugo-modules-getting-started/

** Sections

https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/

From the docs:

A section is a top-level content directory, or any content directory with an
_index.md file. A content directory with an _index.md file is also known as
a branch bundle. Section templates receive one or more page collections in
context.

Top level directories without an _index.md are also sections.

** Static versus Assets

Use the static folder for files that are copied to output folder as-is
without any processing.
