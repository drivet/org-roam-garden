[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] is a static site generator written in Go.

Your entire site becomes a Go module, from what I can tell.

Maybe useful links:

** Sections

https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/

From the docs:

A section is a top-level content directory, or any content directory with an
_index.md file. A content directory with an _index.md file is also known as
a branch bundle. Section templates receive one or more page collections in
context.

Top level directories without an _index.md are also sections.
